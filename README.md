# StrokePredictionModel
This is a stroke prediction model .The main objective of this model is to predict the chances of a person having stroke 
This model  takes inputs like age, gender, blood
pressure, smoking status, BMI, glucose level and predicts whether
the person is prone to stroke or not.
• Using a machine learning model with prediction xgb classifier model ,
working on predicting outcome with the help of Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree, Random Forest.
• Developed a fully functional, regular, responsive page for taking
inputs and showing the outcomes of the model.
• Technology used for frontend: HTML,CSS.
